## General info
This is a movie website that I recently completed from an old project from Campbell University.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* PHP

## Features
* It shows some movies that I enjoy watching
* Offers trailers of movies from Youtube
* Has movie reviews from well known websites 

## Setup
It is recommended to create a localserver on a terminal window (e.g. command line) to see everything in the html files.
First you must be in the Movie_Paradise directory and then enter this command in the terminal if you have Python 3:

...
$ python -m http.server 3000
...

Or this if you have Python 2:

...
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
...

Once this is done, you can then enter http://localhost:3000/ in a web browser.

## Sources
This website was inspired by templatemonster.com at https://www.templatemonster.com/category/game-portal-website-templates/. The pictures are from google 
images, the videos are from youtube, and many links lead to popular websites that talk about movies (e.g. ign.com, screenrant.com, etc.).
